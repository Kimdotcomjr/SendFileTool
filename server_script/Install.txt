How to install a file sending server

1) If you want delete all files older than 1 day, edit "clean_oneday.sh" script
and replace absolute path to folder where you will store uploaded files.
Then run "chmod u+x clean_oneday.sh" from terminal.

Recommended cron task:
*/10	*	*	*	*	/path/to/clean_oneday.sh

2) edit _config.php and set your actual paths (where upload and which base URL will be used for returning URL to client)
